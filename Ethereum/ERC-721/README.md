# Smart Contract ERC-721

## Description

It is a simple ERC721 Smart Contract.
ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible, each and every ERC-721 token has its own unique value and is to be treated individually.

## How this is build

I have build this smart contract using the Solidity and the library openzeppelin contracts.

## Tech Stack Used

I have used following tech stacks:-

- Solidity
- Remix
- OpenZeppelin

## Steps to Run

To run it, we just have to copy the smart contract into [Remix ide](https://remix.ethereum.org/), remix automatically compiles the contract. Then we to just deploy, smart contract's constructor doesn't take any arguments. After deployment we can mint nft using mintNft function. That's all.
